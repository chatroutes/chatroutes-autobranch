## [Unreleased]

## [1.3.0] - 2025-10-27

### Added

#### Conversation Analysis & Intelligent Routing (NEW! ðŸŽ‰)

- **ConversationFlowAnalyzer** - Hybrid detection combining explicit and semantic branch detection
  - Explicit detection using BRANCH: markers (100% confidence)
  - Semantic detection for implicit patterns:
    - Topic shifts via embedding similarity
    - Decision points (curiosity â†’ commitment patterns)
    - Question â†’ Action transitions
  - Combined graph output showing conversation flow
  - Configurable topic shift threshold

- **IntelligentRouter** - Heuristic-based automatic LLM decision making
  - 5 heuristics for LLM value estimation:
    - Complexity (turn length, vocabulary diversity)
    - Ambiguity (hedging language, conditionals)
    - Hybrid Quality (branches found - inverse metric)
    - Coverage (% turns covered - inverse metric)
    - Implicit Signals ("torn between", complex conditionals)
  - Weighted decision formula with configurable threshold
  - Budget constraints (time, cost)
  - Three optimization strategies: balanced, speed-optimized, thoroughness-optimized
  - **LLM is opt-in by default** (enable_llm_routing=False)

- **AutoRouter** - Convenience wrapper for intelligent routing
  - Automatically executes hybrid analysis
  - Conditionally uses LLM based on heuristics
  - Verbose mode for decision explanations
  - Returns combined results with metadata

### Key Features

- **Opt-in LLM**: Default is hybrid-only (fast, free), LLM requires explicit enable_llm_routing=True

### Performance

| Method | Speed | Cost | Detection Quality |
|--------|-------|------|------------------|
| Hybrid Only | <0.1s | $0 | Excellent for most cases |
| + Intelligent Router (skipped) | <0.1s | $0 | Same as hybrid |
| + Intelligent Router (used) | 1-5s | ~$0.0001 | Best for complex/ambiguous |

## [1.2.0] - 2025-01-27

**Note**: This release contains the same features as 0.2.0. Due to PyPI version ordering (1.1.0 > 0.2.0), we're publishing as 1.2.0 to ensure users get the latest code. See version history below for details.

### Version History Clarification

- `0.1.0` â†’ Initial release (correct)
- `1.0.1` â†’ Should have been 0.1.1 (versioning error)
- `1.1.0` â†’ Should have been 0.2.0 (versioning error)
- `0.2.0` â†’ Published but PyPI shows 1.1.0 as "latest" due to version comparison
- `1.2.0` â†’ **Current release** - contains 0.2.0 features with corrected version for PyPI

**Moving forward**: Versions will continue from 1.2.0 following semantic versioning.

### Design Decisions
- **Deterministic Core**: All modules use fixed tie-breaking and seeded randomization for reproducibility

### Known Limitations
- No async/await support (planned for v0.3.0)
- K-means clustering only (HDBSCAN adapter planned)
