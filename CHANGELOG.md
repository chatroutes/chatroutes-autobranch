## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2025-01-27

### Added

#### Branch Detection Module (NEW! ðŸŽ‰)
- **BranchExtractor** for deterministic pattern-based branch point extraction
  - Enumerations detection (numbered lists 1. 2. 3., bullets -, *, â€¢)
  - Disjunctions detection ("or" patterns: A or B or C)
  - Conditionals detection (if...then...else patterns)
  - Combinatorial counting (calculate Î (k1 Ã— k2 Ã— ... Ã— kn))
  - Statistics and complexity metrics (total branches, max leaves, breakdown by type)

- **BranchPoint & BranchOption** data models
  - Type-safe dataclasses for branch representation
  - Support for nested dependencies (depends_on field)
  - Context preservation for original text spans
  - Metadata support for custom extensions

- **LLMBranchParser** for optional LLM-assisted extraction
  - JSON schema enforcement for structured extraction
  - Fallback mechanism for complex/implicit choices
  - Confidence metadata tracking
  - Retry logic with error handling

- **Interactive Colab Notebook** - `branch_detection_demo.ipynb`
  - Try-your-own-text interactive sections
  - Real-world LLM response analysis
  - Pattern reference guide
  - Conversation path analysis examples
  - Optional LLM integration demo

#### Documentation
- **BRANCH_DETECTION_MODULE.md** - Complete module documentation with API reference
- **BRANCHING_DETERMINATION_GUIDE.md** - User FAQ: "How to determine branches from text?"
- **BRANCHING_ANALYSIS.md** - 5 approaches to analyze branching potential
- **BRANCH_DETECTION_RELEASE.md** - Comprehensive release notes

#### Examples
- `branch_detection_usage.py` - Complete usage examples with 5 scenarios
- `analyze_branching_potential.py` - Heuristic vs LLM analysis tools

#### Tests
- 34 comprehensive tests for branch_detection module
- 93% code coverage (extractor), 92% (parser), 100% (models)
- Edge case coverage (empty text, single items, nested patterns)

### Changed
- Updated README.md with branch detection feature section
- Updated notebooks/README.md with new Colab notebook
- Enhanced package description in pyproject.toml
- Updated __init__.py with branch_detection exports

### Technical Details
- **Pattern Detection**: Uses regex-based deterministic matching
- **Performance**: ~1-5ms per text (no API calls for deterministic mode)
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: Module is completely optional
- **Thread-Safe**: Stateless extractors safe for concurrent use

### Use Cases
- Pre-analyze LLM responses before branching generation
- Count conversation path complexity
- Estimate branching potential without generation
- Extract structured choices from unstructured text
- Budget planning for tree exploration

- Example code updates for better usability

---

## [0.1.0] - 2025-01-19

### Added

#### Core Components
- **Beam Search** with configurable beam width (K)
  - Composite scoring with weighted features: confidence, relevance, novelty_parent, intent_alignment, historical_reward
  - Deterministic tie-breaking via lexicographic ID ordering
  - Support for custom scorers via Protocol interface

- **Novelty Filtering** for diversity enforcement
  - Cosine similarity threshold method (default 0.85)
  - MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance) implementation with lambda parameter
  - Deterministic pruning order (score-descending processing)

- **Entropy-Based Stopping** for convergence detection
  - Shannon entropy on K-means clusters of candidate embeddings
  - Delta-entropy tracking across generations
  - Stateful entropy stopper with checkpoint/resume support
  - Normalized entropy scale [0,1] with configurable thresholds

- **Budget Management** for cost control
  - Multi-dimensional budgets: max_nodes, max_tokens, max_ms
  - Strict and soft enforcement modes
  - Pre-admit budget checking and post-update usage tracking
  - Rolling averages for improved estimation

#### Integrations
- **Embedding Providers**
  - OpenAI embeddings (text-embedding-3-large)
  - HuggingFace Transformers (sentence-transformers)
  - Dummy provider for testing and offline development

- **FastAPI Service Layer**
  - HTTP `/select` endpoint for language-agnostic access
  - Thread-safe per-request selector instantiation
  - Health check and config introspection endpoints
  - TypeScript client example included

#### Developer Experience
- **Configuration System**
  - YAML/JSON config file support
  - Environment variable overrides with double-underscore nesting
  - Pydantic-based validation with clear error messages
  - Multiple config loading methods (file, dict, unified)

- **Observability**
  - Structured JSON logging with configurable levels
  - Rich metrics per step (kept/pruned counts, scores, entropy, budget)
  - OpenTelemetry span instrumentation (optional)
  - PII-safe logging (text logging disabled by default)

- **Checkpointing**
  - Serializable checkpoint format with schema versioning
  - State management for entropy history and budget tracking
  - Resume from checkpoint with full state restoration
  - Backward-compatible checkpoint loading

#### Testing & Quality
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**
  - Unit tests for all core components
  - Property-based tests using Hypothesis
  - Golden-file tests for reproducibility
  - Thread-safety tests for concurrent usage
  - Edge case coverage (empty sets, small sets, budget exhaustion)

- **Benchmarks**
  - Performance benchmarks for K scaling
  - Diversity analysis for novelty thresholds
  - Tree depth analysis for entropy cutoffs
  - Baseline performance metrics documented

#### Documentation
- **Complete Technical Specification** (chatroutes_autobranch_v1.0.md)
  - 20 sections covering philosophy, design, API, examples, tuning
  - Algorithm specifications with pseudocode
  - Configuration reference with all parameters
  - Troubleshooting guide with common failure patterns
  - Performance benchmarks and optimization tips

- **Developer-Friendly README**
  - Quick start guide (< 5 minutes to first result)
  - Multiple usage examples (basic, multi-generation, custom scorer)
  - Integration examples (LangChain, LlamaIndex, FastAPI)
  - FAQ and tuning guidance

- **Contributing Guidelines**
  - Development setup instructions
  - Code standards and tooling requirements
  - Pull request process
  - Community guidelines (Contributor Covenant)

### Design Decisions
- **Deterministic Core**: All modules use fixed tie-breaking and seeded randomization for reproducibility
- **Zero Heavy Dependencies**: Core library has minimal deps; extras enable optional features
- **Protocol-Based Design**: All components use Python Protocols for easy swapping and testing
- **Thread-Safe**: Per-request selector instantiation pattern for concurrent usage
- **Embedding Reuse**: Parent and candidate embeddings batched and cached per step() for efficiency

### Known Limitations
- No async/await support (planned for v0.3.0)
- K-means clustering only (HDBSCAN adapter planned)
- No built-in tree visualization (planned for v0.4.0)
- Local state only (no distributed state management)

### Breaking Changes
- N/A (initial release)
